***************************************************

.. zephyr:board-supported-runners::

Prerequisite
============

Before you can run Zephyr on the STM32MP257F-EV1 Evaluation board, you need to
set up the Cortex |reg|-A35 core with a Linux |reg| environment. The Cortex
|reg|-M33 core runs Zephyr as a coprocessor, and it requires the Cortex
|reg|-A35 to load and start the firmware using remoteproc.

One way to set up the Linux environment is to use the official ST
OpenSTLinux distribution, following the `Starter Package`_. (more information
about the procedure can be found in the `STM32MPU Wiki`_)

Loading the firmware
====================

Once the OpenSTLinux distribution is installed on the board, the Cortex |reg|
-A35 is responsible (in the current distribution) for loading the Zephyr
firmware image in DDR and/or SRAM and starting the Cortex |reg| -M33 core. The
application can be built using west, taking the :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` as
an example.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: stm32mp257f_ev1/stm32mp257fxx/m33
   :goals: build

The firmware can be copied to the board file system and started with the Linux
remoteproc framework. (more information about the procedure can be found in the
`STM32MP257F boot Cortex-M33 firmware`_)

Debugging
=========
Applications can be debugged using OpenOCD and GDB. The OpenOCD files can be
found at `device-stm-openocd`_.
The firmware must first be started by the Cortex |reg|-A35. The debugger can
then be attached to the running Zephyr firmware using OpenOCD.

- Build the sample:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: stm32mp257f_ev1/stm32mp257fxx/m33
   :goals: build

- Copy the firmware to the board, load it and start it with remoteproc
  (`STM32MP257F boot Cortex-M33 firmware`_). The orange LED should be blinking.
- Attach to the target:

.. code-block:: console

   $ west attach

Programming and Debugging with the Cortex |reg|-A35
***************************************************

Prerequisite
============

The STM32MP257 has a DDR controller that need to be initialized before loading the Zephyr example.

One method to perform this is to flash the Zephyr executable, along with the DDR initialization script, on an SD card inserted in the board. To do so, you first need to :ref:`install STM32CubeProgrammer <stm32cubeprog-flash-host-tools>` and download the `STM32MP2 starter package`_

In order to debug Zephyr you will also need to `Install the STM32MP2 Developer package`_

Loading
=======

Once you have downloaded the `STM32MP2 starter package`_ copy :zephyr_file:`boards/st/stm32mp257f_ev1/support/Zephyr.tsv` to ``${Path_to_MP2_Starter_Package}/en.FLASH-stm32mp2-openstlinux-6.6-yocto-scarthgap-mpu-v24.12.05/.../stm32mp2/flashlayout_st-image-weston/optee/``.

Then using STM32CubeProgrammer, flash the SD card with the custom tsv file. You can take a look at how to `Populate the target and boot the image`_

You can now take of the SD Card from the board and insert it in your computer.

In a dedicated folder open a terminal and replace tfa with the custom one :zephyr_file:`boards/st/stm32mp257f_ev1/support/bootloader/tf-a-stm32mp257f-ev1-wrapped.stm32`:

  .. code-block:: console
      dd if=tf-a-stm32mp257f-ev1-wrapped.stm32 of=/dev/disk/by-partlabel/fsbla1 conv=fdatasync

Then make a copy of the fip file and update it with the custom bl31 :zephyr_file:`boards/st/stm32mp257f_ev1/support/bootloader/bl31.bin` and bl2 :zephyr_file:`boards/st/stm32mp257f_ev1/support/bootloader/bl2.bin` and your zephyr binary file :

  .. code-block:: console
      mkdir fip
      pv -r -p </dev/sda5> ./fip/fip.bin && sync

      fiptool update --tb-fw bl2.bin fip/fip.bin
      fiptool update --tos-fw zephyr.bin fip/fip.bin
      fiptool update --soc-fw bl31.bin fip/fip.bin

      pv -r -p >/dev/sda5 <./fip/fip.bin && sync

You can now use Zephyr on the SD card.

If you want to change your application on the SD Card you will only have to update the zephyr.bin in the fip

Debugging
=========

.. note::
  West commands aren't supported at the moment for the cortex A35 for this board.

In order to debug Zephyr you will need the SDK from STMicroelectronics.

Firstly you will need to move these files:
  -:zephyr_file:`boards/st/stm32mp257f_ev1/support/stm32mp25x_dk_nosmp.cfg`
  -:zephyr_file:`boards/st/stm32mp257f_ev1/support/stm32mp25x_dk_smp.cfg`
In the ``${Path_to_Developer-Package}/SDK/sysroots/x86_64-ostl_sdk-linux/usr/share/openocd/scripts/board/`` folder.

And move these files:
  -:zephyr_file:`boards/st/stm32mp257f_ev1/support/stm32mp25x_nosmp.cfg`
  -:zephyr_file:`boards/st/stm32mp257f_ev1/support/stm32mp25x_smp.cfg`
In the ``${Path_to_Developer-Package}/SDK/sysroots/x86_64-ostl_sdk-linux/usr/share/openocd/scripts/targets/`` folder.

Then source two consoles using:
.. code-block:: console
  source ${Path_to_Developer-Package}/SDK/environment-setup-cortexa35-ostl-linux

In the first console, connect to the board using:
.. code-block:: console
  openocd -f board/stm32mp25x_dk_nosmp.cfg

or if you use the smp:
.. code-block:: console
  openocd -f board/stm32mp25x_dk_smp.cfg -c 'init;init_smp'

In the second console connect to GDB via:
.. code-block:: console
  $GDB -ex "target remote localhost:3333"

.. note::
  GDB have some issues to deal with architecture switch.
  In fact during the TFA boot process we jump from aarch64 to aarch32 after the DDR init to run Zephyr.
  You have to make sure to be in Zephyr to be able to debug without problems as GDB will stop working during the switch.
  Moreover if you use the SMP you will need both cores to be in Zephyr as GDB cannot deal with multi architecture cores.
