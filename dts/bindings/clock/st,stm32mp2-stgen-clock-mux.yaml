  STM32MP2 CPU Clock

  Describes the STM32MP2 STGEN clock multiplexer. On STM32MP2, this is the STGEN
  clock that feeds the SysTick.

  For instance:
  cpusw: cpusw {
    #clock-cells = <0>;
    clocks = <&clk_hsi>;
    clock-frequency = <DT_FREQ_M(64)>;
    compatible = "st,stm32mp2-stgen-clock-mux", "st,stm32-clock-mux";
    status = "okay";
  };

compatible: "st,stm32mp2-stgen-clock-mux"

include:
  - name: base.yaml
    property-allowlist:
      - status
      - compatible
      - clocks

properties:
  clock-frequency:
    required: true
    type: int
